## Introduction

This is a comprehensive algorithm interview guide covering 40+ classic problems with detailed analysis and template code. The guide is organized by algorithmic patterns and prioritized by company focus (Google, Meta, Amazon).

## What's Covered

The guide includes the following topics:

1. **Greedy Algorithm** - Assignment problems, Interval scheduling
2. **Two Pointers** - Opposite pointers, Sliding window, Fast-slow pointers
3. **Binary Search** - Standard search, Boundary search, Search on answer
4. **Sorting** - Custom sorting, Quickselect, Bucket sort
5. **Prefix Sum** - Subarray sum, Contiguous array
6. **Stack and Queue** - Parentheses matching, Monotonic stack
7. **DFS** - Grid search, Cycle detection, Memoized search
8. **BFS** - Shortest path, Multi-source BFS
9. **Dijkstra** - Weighted graph shortest path
10. **Dynamic Programming** - Linear DP, String DP, Knapsack, Stock problems
11. **Divide and Conquer** - Merge K sorted lists
12. **Trie** - Prefix tree, Word search
13. **Topological Sort** - Course scheduling
14. **Union-Find** - Connected components, Cycle detection
15. **LRU Cache** - Hash map + Doubly linked list
16. **Bit Manipulation** - XOR tricks, Counting bits

## Key Features

- **Priority Labels**: Problems are labeled with company focus (G=Google, M=Meta, A=Amazon) and priority levels (P0/P1/P2)
- **Template Code**: Reusable code templates for each pattern
- **Detailed Analysis**: Step-by-step problem breakdown and complexity analysis
- **Interview Tips**: Communication strategies and edge case handling
