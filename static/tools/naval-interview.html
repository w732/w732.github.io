Is success worth it then?&quot;</p></div></div>
<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>Oof. I'm not sure that statement is true anymore. Like, I made that statement a long time ago, and a lot of these things are just notes to myself, and they're <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;highly&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;高度地， 很， 非常；赞许地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:44&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) In a high or esteemed manner.&quot;}'>highly</span> contextual. They come in the moment, they leave in the moment. Happiness... <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;okay&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;对，好&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Endorsement; approval.; (verb) To approve.; (adjective) All right, permitted.&quot;}'>Okay</span>. So, very <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;complicated&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;难懂的， 复杂的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:12&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(verb) To make complex; to modify so as to make something intricate or difficult.; (adjective) Difficult or convoluted.&quot;}'>complicated</span> topic, but I always like the Socrates story where he goes into the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;marketplace&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;市场； 市集&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) An open area in a town housing a public market.&quot;}'>marketplace</span> and they show him all these <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;luxury&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;奢华的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Very wealthy and comfortable surroundings.; (adjective) Very expensive&quot;}'>luxuries</span> and fineries, and he says, &quot;How many things there are in this world that I do not want.&quot; And that's a form of freedom.  So, not wanting something is as good as having it. In the old story with Alexander and Diogenes, right? Alexander goes out and <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;conquer&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;以武力征服&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(verb) To defeat in combat; to subjugate.&quot;}'>conquers</span> the world, and he meets Diogenes, who's living in a <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;barrel&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;把…装桶&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A round vessel or cask, of greater length than breadth, and bulging in the middle, made of staves bound with hoops, and having flat ends or heads. Sometimes applied to a similar cylindrical container made of metal, usually called a drum.; (verb) To put or to pack in a barrel or barrels.&quot;}'>barrel</span>. And Diogenes says, &quot;Get out of the way, you're blocking my sun.&quot; And Alexander says, &quot;Oh, how I wish I could be like Diogenes in the next life.&quot; And Diogenes says, &quot;That's the difference. I don't wish that I could...&quot; Sorry, Diogenes says, &quot;I don't wish to be Alexander.&quot; So, two paths to happiness.  One path is success: you get what you want, you satisfy your material needs. Or, like Diogenes, you just don't want in the first place. And I'm not sure which one is more valid. Um, and it also depends what you <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;define&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;定义， 解释； 限定&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:62&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A kind of macro in source code that replaces one text string with another wherever it occurs.; (verb) To determine with precision; to mark out with distinctness; to ascertain or exhibit clearly.&quot;}'>define</span> as success. If the end goal is happiness, then why not cut to the chase and just go straight for it? &quot;Does being happy make you less successful?&quot; That is a conventional wisdom. That may even be the practical, earned experience of your reality. You find that when you're happy, you don't want anything, so you don't get up and do anything.  On the other hand, you know, you still got to do something. You're an animal. You're here. You're here to survive. You're here to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;replicate&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;复制，重复；&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:15&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) The outcome of a replication procedure; an exact copy or replica.; (verb) To make a copy (replica) of.; (adjective) Folded over or backward; folded back upon itself.&quot;}'>replicate</span>. You're driven, you're <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;motivate&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;激发， 刺激&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:11&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(verb) To provide someone with an incentive to do something; to encourage.&quot;}'>motivated</span>. You're going to do something. You're not just going to sit there all day. <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;unlikely&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;不太可能的； 没有希望的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:22&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Something or somebody considered unlikely.; (adjective) Not likely; improbable; not to be reasonably expected.; (adverb) In an improbable manner.&quot;}'>Unlikely</span>. Some people do, maybe it's in their nature. But I think most people still want to act; they want to live in the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;arena&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;表演场地， 竞技场； 活动场所&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) An enclosed area, often outdoor, for the presentation of sporting events (sports arena) or other spectacular events; earthen area, often oval, specifically for rodeos (North America) or circular area for bullfights (especially Hispanic America).&quot;}'>arena</span>. Uh, I found for myself, as I've become... &quot;happier&quot; is a big word, but you know, more peaceful, more calm, more present,  more satisfied with what I have... I still want to do things. I just want to do bigger things. I want to do things that are more pure, more <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;align&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;结盟； 排整齐； 校准； 使一致&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:25&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(verb) To form a line; to fall into line.&quot;}'>aligned</span> with what I think needs to be done and what I can <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;uniquely&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;adv独特地, 唯一地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:10&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) In a unique manner.&quot;}'>uniquely</span> do. So, in that sense, I think that being happier can <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;actually&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;实际上；竟然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) (modal) In act or in fact; really; in truth; positively.&quot;}'>actually</span> make you more successful, but your <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;definition&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;定义&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:6&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A statement of the meaning of a word or word group or a sign or symbol (dictionary definitions).&quot;}'>definition</span> of success will likely change along the way.</p></div></div>
<div class="msg chris"><div class="avatar">CW</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Chris</div><p>Is that a realization you think you could have gotten to had you not had some success in the first place?</p></div></div>
<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>At least for me, I always wanted to take the path of material success first.  I was not going to go be an ascetic and sit there and <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;renounce&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;声明放弃； 拒绝承认&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) An act of renouncing.; (verb) To give up, resign, surrender, atsake.&quot;}'>renounce</span> everything. That just seems too unrealistic and too painful. Uh, in the story of Buddha, he starts out as a <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;prince&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;王子； 亲王&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:10&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A (male) ruler, a sovereign; a king, monarch.&quot;}'>prince</span>, and then he sees that it's all kind of <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;meaningless&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;无意义的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adjective) Lacking meaning.&quot;}'>meaningless</span> because you're still going to get old and die. And then he goes into the woods looking for something more. I'll take the happy route that <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;involve&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;包含， 含有； 参与； 牵涉， 牵连&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:94&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(verb) To roll or fold up; to wind round; to entwine.&quot;}'>involves</span> material success, thank you.  I think it's quicker in some ways. You know, one of your <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;insight&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;洞察力， 见识&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:25&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A sight or view of the interior of anything; a deep inspection or view; introspection; frequently used with into.&quot;}'>insights</span> is: &quot;It's far easier to achieve our material desires than it is to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;renounce&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;声明放弃； 拒绝承认&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) An act of renouncing.; (verb) To give up, resign, surrender, atsake.&quot;}'>renounce</span> them.&quot;</p></div></div>
<div class="msg chris"><div class="avatar">CW</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Chris</div><p>And uh...</p></div></div>
<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>It depends on the person, but I think you have to try that path. If you want something, go get it.  Uh, you know, like I quipped that &quot;the reason to win the game is to be free of it.&quot; So, you play the games, you win the games, and then you get... hopefully, you get <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;bore&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;钻， 挖， 打眼， 钻探；烦扰， 使厌烦&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:4&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A hole drilled or milled through something, or (by extension) its diameter.; (verb) To inspire boredom in somebody.; (noun) A sudden and rapid flow of tide occuring in certain rivers and estuaries which rolls up as a wave.&quot;}'>bored</span> of the games. You don't want to just keep <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;loop&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;回路&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A length of thread, line or rope that is doubled over to make an opening.; (noun) A mass of iron in a pasty condition gathered into a ball for the tilt hammer or rolls.; (verb) To form something into a loop.&quot;}'>looping</span> on the same game over and over, although a lot of these games are very <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;entice&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;诱惑， 引诱&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(verb) To lure; to attract by arousing desire or hope.&quot;}'>enticing</span> and have many levels and are relatively open-ended. Uh, and then you become free of the game  in a sense that you're no longer trying to win it. You know you can win it. Uh, and either you move to a different game or you play the game for the sheer joy of it.</p></div></div>
<div class="msg chris"><div class="avatar">CW</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Chris</div><p>Yeah. Another one of yours: &quot;Most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term so you can get paid in the long term.&quot; I think that's classic winning the marshmallow test on a daily basis. But, uh, there's an interesting challenge where I think people need to avoid becoming a suffering addict.  Sort of using suffering as the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;proxy&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;代理人&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:15&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Used as a proxy or acting as a proxy.; (Noun) An agent or substitute authorized to act for another person.; (Verb) To serve as a proxy for.&quot;}'>proxy</span> for progress, as opposed to the outcome of the suffering. Right? It's like, &quot;I was in pain not eating the marshmallow. I was in pain doing this work. I have attached well-being and satisfaction to pain, not to what the pain gets me on the other side of it.&quot;</p></div></div>
<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>If you <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;define&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;定义， 解释； 限定&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:62&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A kind of macro in source code that replaces one text string with another wherever it occurs.; (verb) To determine with precision; to mark out with distinctness; to ascertain or exhibit clearly.&quot;}'>define</span> pain as physical pain, then it's a real thing. It happens, and you can't ignore it. But that's not what we mean by suffering.  Suffering is mostly mental anguish and mental pain. And it just means you don't want to do the task at hand.  Uh, if you were fine doing the task at hand, then you wouldn't be suffering. And then the question is, what's more <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;effective&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;有效的， 生效的； 给人印象深刻的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:44&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Having the power to produce a required effect or effects.; (Noun) a soldier fit for duty&quot;}'>effective</span>? To suffer along the way, or just to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;interpret&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;解释， 说明； 演绎&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:10&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To decode the meaning of a topic and then act, whether to continue researching the topic, follow through, act in opposition, or further the understanding through sharing an interpretation.&quot;}'>interpret</span> it in a way that it's not suffering? You hear from a lot of successful people, they look back and they say, &quot;Oh, the journey was the fun part, right? That was <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;actually&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;实际上；竟然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) (modal) In act or in fact; really; in truth; positively.&quot;}'>actually</span> the entertaining part, and I should have enjoyed it more.&quot; It's a common regret. Uh, there's a little thought exercise I like to do, which is you can go back into your own life and  try to put yourself in the exact <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;posit&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;断定， 认为&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:31&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) Something that is posited; a postulate.; (Verb) To assume the existence of; to postulate.&quot;}'>position</span> you were in 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. And you try to remember, &quot;<span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;okay&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;对，好&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Endorsement; approval.; (verb) To approve.; (adjective) All right, permitted.&quot;}'>Okay</span>, who was I with? What was I doing? What was I feeling? What were my emotions? What were my <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;objective&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;客观的；&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Of or relating to a material object, actual existence or reality.; (Noun) A material object that physically exists.&quot;}'>objectives</span>?&quot; And really, really try to transport yourself back and see if there's any advice you'd give yourself. Anything you'd do <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;differently&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;不同地，有差别地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:6&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) In a different way.&quot;}'>differently</span>? Now, you don't have new information.  And don't pretend you could have gone back and, you know, bought a <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;stock&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;储备&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:16&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A store or supply.\n\n  A store of goods ready for sale; inventory.; (Verb) To have on hand for sale.; (Adjective) Of a type normally available for purchase/in stock.&quot;}'>stock</span> or bought Bitcoin or whatever. But just knowing what you know now in terms of your temperament and a little bit of age-related experience, how would you have done things <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;differently&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;不同地，有差别地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:6&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) In a different way.&quot;}'>differently</span>? And I think it's a worthwhile exercise to do.

And so, for example, I did this Joe Rogan podcast, I don't know, it's like eight or nine years ago.  Um, and people will call out like the thing that didn't turn out to be correct, right? And it's just like, and they just beat on it because it helps them in their mind raise their status a little bit. &quot;Aha, I caught him in an error.&quot; Well, I think if you catch someone in a blatant lie,  where they believe one thing and they say another, that's legit. That's a character <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;flaw&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;生裂缝； 变得有缺陷&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:17&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A flake, fragment, or shiver.; (Verb) To add a flaw to, to make imperfect or defective.; (Noun) A sudden burst or gust of wind of short duration; windflaw.&quot;}'>flaw</span>. They shouldn't be lying.  But on the other hand, if they just made a guess at something and they got it wrong... And by the way, mostly it's about the AI/AGI thing, and I think I'm still right about that, but it's a different story. Um, people who think we have achieved AGI just fail a Turing test from their side.  Um, but, uh, it's funny how people latch on to single proclamations. But the reality is, all of us are dynamical systems.  We're always changing. We're always <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;learning&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;学习； 学问， 知识&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:8&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) An act in which something is learned.; (Verb) present participle and gerund of learn&quot;}'>learning</span>. We're always growing. And, uh, hopefully we're correcting errors. What you don't want to be doing is lying in public so that... because you're trying to look good. And I think people can smell that. I... what this world really lacks right now is <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;authenticity&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;确实性； 真实性&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:6&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The quality of being genuine or not corrupted from the original, of having the same origin (or attribution, commitment, intention, etc.) as claimed.&quot;}'>authenticity</span>. And because everybody wants something, they want to be seen as something, they want to be something that they're not. And so, you do catch a lot of people, uh, saying things that they don't really believe. And I think people are very sensitive to that.</p></div></div>

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>I think it just helps to see that status games don't matter as much as they used to.

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>Exactly. Yeah. It's... it's vague and it's fuzzy.  Now, you see people get rich, they have money. What do they want? They want status. So, they go to Hollywood, start starring in movies, they donate to nonprofits, they go to Cannes or Davos or what have you.  Um, and they start trying to trade the money for status. So, you know, people always want what they don't have. Uh, and we are evolutionarily hardwired for status because, as I said, wealth <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;creation&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;产生&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:30&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) Something created such as an invention or artwork.&quot;}'>creation</span> didn't really exist until the agricultural revolution, uh, when you could store grain.

But there's never been an easier time to make money.  Yes, it's still hard, but there's never been an easier time to create wealth because there's so much leverage out there. There's so much opportunity. You still have to go find it. It's not easy. It's not going to fall on your lap. And you have to learn something and know something and do something interesting. But nevertheless, it's possible to many more people. A few hundred years ago, you were born a serf, you were going to die a serf. There was almost no way out of that. That's changed. And so, I would argue that you're better off focusing on wealth games than status games. If you're trying to, um, build up, for example, your following on a social network and get famous and then get rich off of being famous, that's a much harder path than getting rich first,  um, and then go for your fame afterwards would be my advice.</p></div></div>

Uh, but that sacrifice can also be thought of as you're thinking for the long term rather than the short term. Um, for example, the virtues are the set of...

And I think a lot of the virtues work this way, right? If I don't go around sleeping with your wife and you don't sleep with mine, and you know, if I don't take all the food that's at the table first, and so on, then we all get along better and we can play win-win games.

So, most of... and that game has two stable <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;equilibrium&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;平衡&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The condition of a system in which competing influences are balanced, resulting in no net change.&quot;}'>equilibriums</span>. And one could be where we're both hunting the rabbit, and one could be where we're hunting the stag. So, the high-trust society is a more... most... more virtuous society, where I can trust you to come hunt the stag with me and show up on time and do the work and divide it up properly. So, you want to live in a system where everybody has their own set of virtues and follows them, and then we all win. But I would argue you don't need to do that for sacrifice. You don't need to do that for other people. You can do it just <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;purely&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;仅仅；简单地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) Wholly; really, completely. .mw-parser-output .defdate{font-size:smaller}; (Adjective) Well, in good health.&quot;}'>purely</span> for yourself.

You will attract other high-virtue people.</p></div></div>

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>Yeah. In that way... On the love thing, one of the interesting things about love is you can try to remember the feeling of being loved. So, go back to when someone was in love with you or someone did love you, and like really remember that feeling. Like, really sit with it and try to recreate it within yourself. And then go to the feeling of you loving someone, and when you were in love. And I'm not even talking about <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;romantic&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;爱情的； 浪漫的， 富有情调的； 多情的； 不切实际的， 幻想的； [R-]浪漫主义的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:9&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Of a work of literature, a writer etc.: being like or having the characteristics of a romance, or poetic tale of a mythic or quasi-historical time; fantastic. .mw-parser-output .defdate{font-size:smaller}; (Noun) A person with romantic character (a character like those of the knights in a mythic romance).&quot;}'>romantic</span> love <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;necessarily&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;必要地； 必然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:8&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) Inevitably; of necessity.&quot;}'>necessarily</span>.

And, uh, think about when you felt love towards someone or something. And now, which is better? And I would argue that the feeling of being in love is <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;actually&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;实际上；竟然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) (modal) In act or in fact; really; in truth; positively.&quot;}'>actually</span> more exhilarating than the feeling of being loved. Being loved is a little cloying. It's a little too sweet. You kind of want to push the person away. It's a little embarrassing. And you know that if that person is too much into it, that you feel <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;constrain&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;束缚， 强迫； 限制&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To force physically, by strong persuasion or pressuring; to compel; to oblige.&quot;}'>constrained</span>. On the other hand, the feeling of being in love is very expansive. It's very open. It <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;actually&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;实际上；竟然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) (modal) In act or in fact; really; in truth; positively.&quot;}'>actually</span> makes you a better version of yourself.

There are plenty of people in human history who are smart and happy. Uh, and I think it just starts with saying, &quot;Yeah, you know what? I'm going to be happy&quot;. There was a guy that I met in <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;thailand&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;泰国&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:3&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;&quot;}'>Thailand</span> a long time ago, and, uh, he used to work for Tony Robbins.

Because then you can focus on what is in front of you, whatever the biggest problem of that day.

I do it at the moment of <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;curiosity&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;好奇， 好奇心； 珍品， 古董&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:8&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) Inquisitiveness; the tendency to ask and learn about things by asking questions, investigating, or exploring. .mw-parser-output .defdate{font-size:smaller}&quot;}'>curiosity</span>.

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>So... so, I think it's really good to be able to view your own mind and your own thoughts <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;objective&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;客观的；&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Of or relating to a material object, actual existence or reality.; (Noun) A material object that physically exists.&quot;}'>objectively</span>.

Well, if you're not careful, you can end up in a place in life not only that you don't want to be, but one that you didn't even mean to get to. That's if you're kind of <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;proceed&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;继续进行&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:6&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(verb) To move, pass, or go forward or onward; to advance; to carry on&quot;}'>proceeding</span> unconsciously. Uh, how many people... and usually, I think people end up there because they are, uh, going on autopilot with sort of societal expectations or other people's expectations.

You know, Peter Thiel has this whole thing from Rene Girard about how mimetic desires are... desires are picked up from other people. Uh, and some of those are automatically baked into society, like, &quot;You know, go to law school, go to med school, go to whatever, go to business school.&quot; Um, or they might be from watching what your friends are doing and, you know, the other monkeys are doing.

Um, but I think the... the best outcomes come when you think it through for yourself and decide for yourself. And I don't think people spend enough time deciding. For example, we run on these, uh, four-year cycles.

Um, uh, in, uh, college, you know, you go for four years. High school, you go for four years. Um, some things take longer. You know, you have children, they hit puberty 9 years later. That's like a 9-year cycle until that relationship changes. Um, but we're used to these fairly long cycles, multi-year cycles in which we are <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;committed&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;尽忠的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) simple past and past participle of commit; (Adjective) Obligated or locked in (often, but not necessarily, by a pledge) to some course of action.&quot;}'>committed</span> to things.

People decide frivolously which city to live in. And that's going to decide who their friends are, what their jobs are, their opportunity, their weather, their food supply, their air supply, quality of life. You know, it's such an important decision, but people spend so little time thinking it through. I would argue that if you're making a four-year decision, spend a year thinking it through.

Correct. Like, if you go back and you look through failed relationships, uh, probably the biggest regret will be staying in the relationship after you knew it was over. Exactly.

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>Yeah. <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;cynicism&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;犬儒主义, 玩世不恭, 冷嘲热讽&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A distrustful attitude.&quot;}'>Cynicism</span> and pessimism is a tough one. It's... we're <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;naturally&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;当然； 天然地； 天生地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) In a natural manner.&quot;}'>naturally</span> hardwired for it. Again, I go back to evolution. I'm sorry to keep harping on evolution, but within biology, there's very few good explanatory theories. And, you know, theory of evolution by natural <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;selection&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;选择， 挑选； 精选； 被挑选出来的人， 精选品； 可供选择的事物&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:20&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A process by which heritable traits conferring survival and reproductive advantage to individuals, or related individuals, tend to be passed on to succeeding generations and become more frequent in a population, whereas other less favourable traits tend to become eliminated; the differential survival and reproduction of phenotypes.; (noun) The process or act of selecting.&quot;}'>selection</span> is probably the best one. So, if you can't explain something about life or psychology or human nature through evolution, then you probably don't have a good theory for it. And I would say that pessimism is another one that comes out of this. Which is, in the natural environment, you're hardwired to be pessimistic. Because let's say that I see something <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;rustle&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;发出沙沙声&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A soft crackling sound similar to the movement of dry leaves.; (verb) To move (something) with a soft crackling sound.&quot;}'>rustling</span> in the woods. And if I move towards it and it turns out to be food and <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;prey&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;捕食&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:36&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Anything, as goods, etc., taken or got by violence; anything taken by force from an enemy in war; (verb) To act as a predator.&quot;}'>prey</span>, then good, I get to eat one meal. But if it turns out to be a <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;predator&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;食肉动物&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:64&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) Any animal or other organism that hunts and kills other nonplant organisms (their prey), primarily for food.&quot;}'>predator</span>, I get eaten, and that's the end of that. So, we are hardwired to avoid ruin, um, and... and, you know, just dying. So, we are <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;naturally&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;当然； 天然地； 天生地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) In a natural manner.&quot;}'>naturally</span> hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is very different. <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;despite&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;不管， 尽管&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:121&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Preposition) In spite of, not with standing.; (Noun) Disdain, contemptuous feelings, hatred.; (Verb) To vex; to annoy; to offend contemptuously.&quot;}'>Despite</span> whatever problems you may have with modern society, it is far, far safer than living in the jungle and just trying to survive.

For example, when you're <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;invest&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;投资&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:20&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To spend money, time, or energy on something, especially for some benefit or purpose; used with in.; (Noun) A designated area of disturbed weather that is being monitored for potential tropical cyclone development.&quot;}'>investing</span>, if you short a <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;stock&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;储备&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:16&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A store or supply.\n\n  A store of goods ready for sale; inventory.; (Verb) To have on hand for sale.; (Adjective) Of a type normally available for purchase/in stock.&quot;}'>stock</span>, you... the most money you can make is 2x.

So, upside, through... because of leverage, is nearly unlimited. Uh, also in modern society, because there's so many different people you can <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;interact&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;相互作用； 相互配合&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:15&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To act upon each other.\n To engage in communication and other shared activities (with someone).; (Noun) A short act or piece between others, as in a play; a break between acts.&quot;}'>interact</span> with, if you go on a date and it fails, there are <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;infinite&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;无限的， 无穷的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Indefinably large, countlessly great; immense. .mw-parser-output .defdate{font-size:smaller}; (Numeral) Infinitely many.; (Noun) Something that is infinite in nature.&quot;}'>infinite</span> more people to go on a date with.

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>So, anxiety and stress are interesting. They're very related. Stress is when, uh, like if you look at an <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;iron&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;铁&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A common, inexpensive metal, silvery grey when untarnished, that rusts, is attracted by magnets, and is used in making steel: a chemical element having atomic number 26 and symbol Fe.; (Adjective) Made of the metal iron.; (Verb) To pass an iron over (clothing or some other item made of cloth) in order to remove creases.&quot;}'>iron</span> beam, when an <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;iron&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;铁&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A common, inexpensive metal, silvery grey when untarnished, that rusts, is attracted by magnets, and is used in making steel: a chemical element having atomic number 26 and symbol Fe.; (Adjective) Made of the metal iron.; (Verb) To pass an iron over (clothing or some other item made of cloth) in order to remove creases.&quot;}'>iron</span> beam is under stress, it's because it's being bent in two different directions at the same time. So, when your mind is under stress, it's because it has two conflicting desires at once. So, for example, you know, you... you want to be liked, but you want to do something selfish, and you can't <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;reconcile&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;调停， 调解； 调和， 使一致； 使协调， 使和解&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:8&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To restore a friendly relationship; to bring back or return to harmony.&quot;}'>reconcile</span> the two, and so you're under stress. Uh, you want to do something for somebody else, you want to do something for yourself, right? These are examp... You... you don't want to go to work, but you want to make money, so you're under stress. Right? So, you have two conflicting desires. And I think one of the ways to get through stress is to acknowledge that, &quot;Oh, I <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;actually&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;实际上；竟然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) (modal) In act or in fact; really; in truth; positively.&quot;}'>actually</span> have two conflicting desires. And either I need to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;resolve&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;解决； 分解； 决心&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:9&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To find a solution to (a problem).; (Noun) Determination; will power.; (Verb) Alternative spelling of re-solve.&quot;}'>resolve</span> it, I need to pick one and then be <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;okay&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;对，好&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Endorsement; approval.; (verb) To approve.; (adjective) All right, permitted.&quot;}'>okay</span> losing the other, or I will decide later.&quot; But at least just being aware of why you're stressed can help <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;alleviate&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;减轻， 缓和&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:3&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To reduce or lessen the severity of a pain or difficulty.&quot;}'>alleviate</span> a lot of stress. And then anxiety, I think, is sort of this <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;pervasive&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;普遍的， 流行的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:4&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Manifested throughout; pervading, permeating, penetrating or affecting everything.&quot;}'>pervasive</span>, unidentifiable stress, where you're just kind of stressed out all the time and you're not even sure why. And you can't even <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;identify&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;识别， 鉴别&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:151&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To establish the identity of someone or something.&quot;}'>identify</span> the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;underlying&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;在下面的； 根本的， 基础的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:4&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) lying underneath; (Noun) The entity from whose performance a derivative derives its value.; (Verb) present participle and gerund of underlie&quot;}'>underlying</span> problem. I think the reason for that is because you... you have so many, uh, <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;unresolved&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;未解决的，未决定的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) For which no solution has been found.; (Verb) simple past and past participle of unresolve&quot;}'>unresolved</span> problems, <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;unresolved&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;未解决的，未决定的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) For which no solution has been found.; (Verb) simple past and past participle of unresolve&quot;}'>unresolved</span> stress points that have piled up in your life, that you can no longer <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;identify&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;识别， 鉴别&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:151&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To establish the identity of someone or something.&quot;}'>identify</span> what the problems are. And there's this mountain of garbage in your mind, and a little bit of it [is] poking out the top like an iceberg, and that's anxiety. But <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;underneath&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;在下面&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) Below; in a place beneath.; (Preposition) Under, below, beneath.; (Adjective) Under, lower.&quot;}'>underneath</span>, there's a lot of <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;unresolved&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;未解决的，未决定的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) For which no solution has been found.; (Verb) simple past and past participle of unresolve&quot;}'>unresolved</span> things. And so, you just need to kind of go through very carefully every time you're anxious. Like, &quot;<span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;okay&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;对，好&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Endorsement; approval.; (verb) To approve.; (adjective) All right, permitted.&quot;}'>Okay</span>, why am I anxious this time?

We don't spend enough time thinking about the big questions. We kind of give up on them when we're very, very young.

You might as well be dead, because your mind is off doing something else or, you know, living in some imagined reality that is just a very poor substitute for the actual reality. So, one of my recent realizations was, what is wasted time? What is a... what is a waste of time? So, I don't like to waste time. But what is wasted time? And everything is wasted time, in a sense, because nothing matters in the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;ultimate&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;最终的， 结果的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:4&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Final; last in a series.; (Noun) The most basic or fundamental of a set of things; (Verb) To finish; to complete.&quot;}'>ultimate</span>.

And so, what matters is just being present for the thing. So, if you're doing something that you want to do and you're <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;fully&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;充分地,完全地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:28&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) In a full manner; without lack or defect; completely, entirely.; (Verb) To commit or send someone to trial.&quot;}'>fully</span> there for it, then it's not wasted time.

That's a whole.&quot; &quot;Electricity and magnetism are one thing. That's... that's the whole.&quot; Creates that sense of awe. Uh, in art, it's like, &quot;I feel an emotion.

Um, <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;ultimately&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;最后， 终于&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:15&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) Indicating the last item.&quot;}'>ultimately</span>, you will end up wherever is <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;acceptable&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;可接受的, 合意的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Worthy, decent, sure of being accepted or received with at least moderate pleasure.; (Noun) Someone or something that is acceptable.&quot;}'>acceptable</span> to you.

Um, and there are certain things to me that are very, very important where I will not settle for second best. But then there are a lot of other things I just don't care about, because if I spend all my time caring about those things, I don't have the energy for the few things that matter. And, uh, so in decision-m... I have a few heuristics for myself. Other people can use their own, but mine are: If you can't decide, the answer is no. If you're offered an opportunity, if you have a new thing that you're saying yes or no to that is a change from where you're starting, the answer is by <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;违约； 拖欠&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The condition of failing to meet an obligation.; (Verb) To fail to meet an obligation.\n To fail to appear and answer a summons and complaint.\n To fail to fulfill a financial obligation.&quot;}'>default</span> always no. Secondly, uh, if you have two decisions, if you have A or B and both seem like very equal, take the path that's more painful in the short term. The one that's going to be painful immediately. Because your brain is always trying to avoid pain. So any pain that is imminent, it is going to treat as much larger than it <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;actually&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;实际上；竟然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:40&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) (modal) In act or in fact; really; in truth; positively.&quot;}'>actually</span> is. This is kind of like a decision-making <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;equivalent&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;相同的，相当的；&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:6&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Similar or identical in value, meaning or effect; virtually equal.; (Noun) Anything that is virtually equal to something else, or has the same value, force, etc.; (Verb) To make equivalent to; to equal.&quot;}'>equivalent</span> of Taleb's surgeon. Uh, &quot;Taleb surgeon,&quot; where you want the surgeon that doesn't look as good because he's more likely to be a good surgeon. Yeah, it's similar in that appearances are <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;deceive&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;欺骗， 蒙蔽&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:7&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To trick or mislead.&quot;}'>deceiving</span> because you're avoiding conflict. You're avoiding pain. So, take the path [that] is more painful in the short term, because your brain is creating this illusion that the short-term pain is greater than the long-term pain. Because long-term, yeah, you... you'll commit your future self to all kinds of long-term... mañana. Mañana, exactly. Mañana. So, take the more short-term painful one. And then <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;finally&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;最后； 决定性地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:26&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) At the end or conclusion; ultimately.&quot;}'>finally</span>, the last one, which I would credit Kapil Gupta with, uh, is that you want to take it... take the choice that will leave you more equanimous in the long term. By equanimous, he means like more at peace, more mental peace in the long term. So, whatever clears your mind more and will have you having less self-talk in the future, if you can model that out, that is probably the better route to go.

Especially these are early life decisions. Later in life, you have different things to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;optimize&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;使最优化； 充分利用&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:9&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To act optimistically or as an optimist.&quot;}'>optimize</span> for. But early in life, you're trying to figure out who you're with, what you're doing, and where you live. And I think on all three of those, you want to think... you want to think pretty hard about it. And people do some of these unconsciously. You know, who you're with, very often it's like, &quot;Well, we were in a relationship. We stumbled along. It felt <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;okay&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;对，好&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Endorsement; approval.; (verb) To approve.; (adjective) All right, permitted.&quot;}'>okay</span>. It had been enough time, so we got married.&quot; Right? Not great reasons. Maybe not terrible reasons either. I mean, people who overthink these things sometimes don't get the right answer. But maybe here, if you're the kind of person that's not going to settle for second best, you iterate. You iterate on a closed time <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;frame&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;诬陷 so that a verdict of guilty is assured)&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:20&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To fit, as for a specific end or purpose; make suitable or comfortable; adapt; adjust.; (Noun) The structural elements of a building or other constructed object.&quot;}'>frame</span> so you don't run out the clock. And then you decide. Um, on what you do: You try a whole bunch of different things until you find the one that feels like play to you, looks like work to others. You can't lose at it. Um, get some leverage, try to find some practical application of it, and go into that. And then where you live: Uh, where you live is really important. I don't think people spend enough time on that one. I think people pick cities <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;randomly&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;随机地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) In a random manner.&quot;}'>randomly</span> based on where I went to school, or where my family happened to be, or where, uh, my friend was, or &quot;I visited one weekend, I really liked it.&quot; You really want to think it through, because where you live really <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;constrain&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;束缚， 强迫； 限制&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To force physically, by strong persuasion or pressuring; to compel; to oblige.&quot;}'>constrains</span> and <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;define&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;定义， 解释； 限定&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:62&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) A kind of macro in source code that replaces one text string with another wherever it occurs.; (verb) To determine with precision; to mark out with distinctness; to ascertain or exhibit clearly.&quot;}'>defines</span> your opportunities.

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>That's... It's a good essay. I... I think one of the reasons why these lessons are unteachable is because, uh, they're too broad. They have to be applied in <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;context&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;上下文&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:58&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The surroundings, circumstances, environment, background or settings that determine, specify, or clarify the meaning of an event or other occurrence.; (Verb) To knit or bind together; to unite closely.; (Adjective) Knit or woven together; close; firm.&quot;}'>context</span>. A number of the ones that you laid out contradict each other. Like, &quot;Spend more time with your parents&quot; and, &quot;You know, don't work so hard,&quot; but, you know, at the same time, you do want to be successful. Right? I think... I think a lot of these lessons come from down on high from, as you said, like the famous movie star or the billionaire saying, &quot;Oh, you don't need to be happy.&quot; It's like, &quot;Well, <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;okay&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;对，好&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) Endorsement; approval.; (verb) To approve.; (adjective) All right, permitted.&quot;}'>okay</span>, then give it up, [...]&quot; Right? Uh, so in reality, I think many of these contradict each other and they... it's like if you went to school and you just <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;studied&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;深思熟虑的； 认真习得的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) simple past and past participle of study; (Adjective) Practiced; self-conscious; careful; not spontaneous.&quot;}'>studied</span> <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;philosophy&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;哲学； 哲理， 见解&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) An academic discipline that seeks truth through reasoning rather than empiricism, often attempting to provide explanations relating to general concepts such as existence and rationality.; (Verb) To philosophize.&quot;}'>philosophy</span> for four years, you would not know how to live life because you wouldn't know which <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;philosophical&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;哲学的, 达观的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:6&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Of, or pertaining to, philosophy.&quot;}'>philosophical</span> <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;doctrine&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;教义； 学说&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:3&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A belief or tenet, especially about philosophical or theological matters.&quot;}'>doctrine</span> to apply in which circumstance.

Um, yes, you want to visit your parents more often, but you don't want to live with your parents, and you don't want to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;necessarily&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;必要地； 必然&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:8&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) Inevitably; of necessity.&quot;}'>necessarily</span> see them every day or every weekend. Depending on the parent, you might not get along with one of them. So, I think it is <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;highly&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;高度地， 很， 非常；赞许地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:44&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adverb) In a high or esteemed manner.&quot;}'>highly</span> contextual. Um, that said, I... I would argue that once you figure it out for yourself, you can kind of carve these <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;variation&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;变化； 变异&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:56&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The act of varying; a partial change in the form, position, state, or qualities of a thing.&quot;}'>variations</span> on these maxims that apply to you.

And you can also phrase it in a way where it's not trite anymore. So like... Yeah. So, so a lot of my maxims and notes to self are carved in a way that they're modernized. They're saying something true, which might be trite if I didn't say it in a new way or in an interesting way that is more relevant to me today. There was a Nobel Prize winner who said something to the effect of, uh, &quot;Everything worth saying may have been said before, but <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;given&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;规定的，特定的；假定的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) past participle of give; (Preposition) Considering; taking into account.; (Noun) A condition that is assumed to be true without further evaluation.&quot;}'>given</span> that nobody was listening, it must be said again.&quot; Yeah.</p></div></div>

So, we stop thinking about them. So, an example is free will. Do you have free will? Or does anything matter? Is there a meaning to life?  And there... and... and we get stuck in them because, for example, &quot;Is there a meaning to life?&quot; Like, yes, life has a meaning because you're... you're right here. You create your own meaning. This... this moment has all the meaning you could imagine. It's all the meaning there is. On the other hand, you're going to die. It all goes to zero. Heat death of the universe. It has no meaning. Right? So, which one is it? Well, the reason why it seems <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;paradoxical&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;矛盾的； 不正常的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adjective) Having self-contradictory properties.&quot;}'>paradoxical</span> is because you're asking the question of a human here and now, at a certain <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;scale&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;鳞片； 规模； 等级&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:122&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A ladder; a series of steps; a means of ascending.; (Verb) To change the size of something whilst maintaining proportion; especially to change a process in order to produce much larger amounts of the final product.; (Noun) Part of an overlapping arrangement of many small, flat and hard pieces of keratin covering the skin of an animal, particularly a fish or reptile.&quot;}'>scale</span> and a certain time, and then you're answering it from the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;viewpoint&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;观点&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(noun) The position from which something is observed or considered; an angle, outlook or point of view.&quot;}'>viewpoint</span> of the universe over <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;infinite&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;无限的， 无穷的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Indefinably large, countlessly great; immense. .mw-parser-output .defdate{font-size:smaller}; (Numeral) Infinitely many.; (Noun) Something that is infinite in nature.&quot;}'>infinite</span> time.

That's why it seems <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;paradoxical&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;矛盾的； 不正常的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(adjective) Having self-contradictory properties.&quot;}'>paradoxical</span>. The same way you can say, &quot;Do I have free will?&quot;  People debate free will all day long. This... the question is answered at the wrong <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;frame&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;诬陷 so that a verdict of guilty is assured)&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:20&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To fit, as for a specific end or purpose; make suitable or comfortable; adapt; adjust.; (Noun) The structural elements of a building or other constructed object.&quot;}'>frame</span>.

Of course I have free will, because I feel like I have free will, and I treat you like you have free will, and you treat me like I have free will. We have free will. The problem then is you start trying to answer the question as if you're the universe.

No one makes any choices. You know, how could you be any different than the... what the universe wants you to be? And it's all one block universe . So, you don't have free will&quot;. Don't answer the question at the level at which it wasn't asked. So, if God asked the question, &quot;Is there free will?&quot; No, there is no free will. The universe asks a question, there is no free will.

If you want to... if you want an automatic, built-in meaning to life, have kids. Uh, and I think there are these bad psych studies—like most psych studies, unfortunately—that say that people are unhappy when they have kids. Yeah, it's because you're catching [them] in the middle of changing a diaper and you're saying like, &quot;Are you glad you had kids or not?&quot;  Or... or they don't even say that. They say, &quot;Are you happy or not?&quot;  And they say, &quot;No, I'm not happy right now.&quot; But what they don't realize is that person has found something more important than being happy in the moment. They found meaning. And the meaning comes from kids. And if you ask parents, &quot;Do you regret having kids?&quot; I think it would be 99 to 1 against. You know, it would be, &quot;No, I don't regret having kids. I love having kids. I'm so glad I had kids.&quot; It's... it's incredibly rare to meet a parent that regretted having children.</p></div></div>

I get why that's done for practical reasons so that, you know, you can get some sleep and you can go to work in the morning.

<div class="msg chris"><div class="avatar">CW</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Chris</div><p>Yep.</p></div></div>
<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>Um, and so that's the battle that kind of goes on. And the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;democracy&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;民主， 民主主义； 民主政治&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:4&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) Rule by the people, especially as a form of government; either directly or through elected representatives (representative democracy).&quot;}'>democracy</span> has gotten very broad. And so, one of my other quips is that, um, &quot;It's not the right to vote that gives you power, it's power that gives you the right to vote.&quot;  So, we've confused the two. So, what happened was, you know, voting started as a way for people who had power to divide up the power, not fight amongst themselves. The winners of the revolution, the winners of the war, the people in the House of <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;lord&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;主人； 长官； 君主； 贵族&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The master of the servants of a household;  the master of a feudal manor\n\n The male head of a household, a father or husband.\n\n The owner of a house, piece of land, or other possession; (Verb) To domineer or act like a lord.&quot;}'>Lords</span> and the House of Commons, they divide up power amongst themselves to say, &quot;Hey, we have all the money. We have the power. We are the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;knight&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;(欧洲中世纪的)骑士&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:13&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A young servant or follower; a trained military attendant in service of a lord.; (Verb) To confer knighthood upon.&quot;}'>knights</span>. We have the swords. We have the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;warrior&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;战士&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A person who is actively engaged in battle, conflict or warfare; a soldier or combatant.&quot;}'>warriors</span>. We could kill everybody, but we don't want to just fight each other all day long. We don't have to be Game of <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;throne&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;王位； 王权&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:3&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) An impressive seat used by a monarch, often on a raised dais in a throne room and reserved for formal occasions.; (Verb) To place on a royal seat; to enthrone.&quot;}'>Thrones</span> forever. So, we're going to divide up power by voting among ourselves.&quot; But then as society goes on and becomes more and more peaceful, that franchise for voting gets spread. It gets spread to people who don't have land, who don't have power, who may not be able to inflict physical violence. And then eventually you get to the point where everybody's voting. Everybody's voting, and everybody [is] voting for candy and <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;fairy&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;小仙子， 小精灵&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:4&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The realm of faerie; enchantment, illusion.; (Adjective) Like a fairy; fanciful, whimsical, delicate.&quot;}'>fairies</span> and, you know, all the free things in life. Uh, and then eventually people start voting to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;oppress&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;压迫， 压制&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To keep down by unjust force.; (Noun) Oppression.&quot;}'>oppress</span> each other. The 51% in every... in any <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;domain&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;领地， 领土&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:38&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A geographic area owned or controlled by a single person or organization.&quot;}'>domain</span> vote to <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;oppress&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;压迫， 压制&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) To keep down by unjust force.; (Noun) Oppression.&quot;}'>oppress</span> the 49[ers]... the tyranny of the majority. But not all of them are willing to back that up with physical power. And so, you can end up in a situation where people who don't have physical power are using the institutions of the state to control the people who do have physical power. As a simple example, taking the United States: the people who don't have guns voting to disarm the people that do have guns. Right? Well, if the people who do have guns get coordinated and care enough, you can't do that. Right? So, I think eventually these societal structures are <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;unstable&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;不稳定的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:3&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Not stable.; (Verb) To release (an animal) from a stable.&quot;}'>unstable</span>. They break down. And they break down because eventually the people who have the power... and say, &quot;No, wait a minute. You don't get to vote. You... you only got to vote because you had power. And now you don't have power, and you're somehow trying to vote...&quot; All of nature, all of society, all of capitalism, all of human <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;endeavor&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;努力； 事业&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A sincere attempt; a determined or assiduous effort towards a specific goal; assiduous or persistent activity.; (Verb) To exert oneself. .mw-parser-output .defdate{font-size:smaller}&quot;}'>endeavors</span> are underpinned by physical violence. And that is [a] very hard truth to swallow and hard to get away from. Nature is red in tooth and claw. If you don't fight, you don't survive. You don't live, you die. And that's true of everything alive today . And humans are no different. So, giving up physical power and then thinking you can exercise political power fails. Which is why every communist revolution, which is all about equality and kumbaya and brothers and sisters, end up being run by a bunch of thugs. Because if you don't have a way to divide up the wealth based on merit, then it's always going to be based on power and influence. The thugs with the guns always win in the end. So, the question is just, can you keep the thugs... and the... with the guns paid and happy and... successful society where you're allocating based on merit? Because if you can't, then you do it based on power. So, I do think that this battle is not over, but that's because it... it never stopped. It's always been there from day one. It will continue.</p></div></div>

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>You're asking me that question right now? What do I think is ignored by the media but will be <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;studied&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;深思熟虑的； 认真习得的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Verb) simple past and past participle of study; (Adjective) Practiced; self-conscious; careful; not spontaneous.&quot;}'>studied</span> by <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;historian&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;历史学家&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:79&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) A writer of history.&quot;}'>historians</span>? Well, I mean, the media is only focused on very timely things, right? So, it depends if you want to talk about timely or timeless. Right? But as a... as a simple example, if I just look at things that maybe [in] the next five or 10 years that are going to make a <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;massive&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;巨大的， 厚重的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:24&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Very large in size or extent.; (Noun) A homogeneous mass of rock, not layered and without an obvious crystal structure.&quot;}'>massive</span> difference that people are not focused enough on. Um, and I think within two years this will be obvious. So, like they... make a prediction, and predictions are tough. But... and I have to eat it in a few years. Yeah, I'm going have to eat... eat this in a few years. So I'm probably wrong. But, uh, two things that I pay attention to, um, that I don't think, uh, a lot of people do pay attention to... Well, there's a couple. One is I think just how bad modern medicine is. I think people just put a lot more faith in modern medicine than is <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;warrant&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;保证； 批准&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) Authorization or certification; a sanction, as given by a superior.; (Verb) To protect, keep safe (from danger).&quot;}'>warranted</span>. Like our best ideas for a lot of things are surgery, just cutting things out . Right? Uh, treating things that are <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;extraneous&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;无关的； 外来的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Not belonging to, or dependent upon, a thing; without or beyond a thing; foreign.&quot;}'>extraneous</span>, like, &quot;Oh, you don't really need a gallbladder. You don't really need an appendix, or you don't really need tonsils&quot;. Oh, that's false. Every... the surplus... requirement... human body is very, very <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;efficient&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;有效率的； 有能力的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:10&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Making good, thorough, or careful use of resources; not consuming extra. Especially, making good use of time or energy.; (Noun) A cause; something that causes an effect.&quot;}'>efficient</span>. All those things are needed. Um, you know, so I think... I think the state of modern medicine is still pretty bad. We don't have many good explanatory theories in biology. Um, we have <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;germ&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;微生物， 细菌； 萌芽&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:1&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The small mass of cells from which a new organism develops; a seed, bud, spore, or zygote.\n The embryo of a seed, especially of a seed used as a cereal or grain. See Wikipedia article on cereal germ.\n  The small mass of cells from which a part of an organism develops, or a macroscopic but immature form of that part; a bud.; (Verb) To germinate.&quot;}'>germ</span> theory [of] disease, we have, um, evolution, we have, uh, cell theory, we have DNA <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;genetic&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;基因的， 遗传的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:48&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Relating to genetics or genes. .mw-parser-output .defdate{font-size:smaller}&quot;}'>genetics</span>, um, morphogenesis, embryogenesis, and not much else . You know, there's not much else. Everything else is rules of thumb, memorization. &quot;A affects B 'cuz [B] affects C [which] affects D,&quot; but we don't understand the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;underlying&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;在下面的； 根本的， 基础的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:4&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) lying underneath; (Noun) The entity from whose performance a derivative derives its value.; (Verb) present participle and gerund of underlie&quot;}'>underlying</span> explanation. It's all just words pointing to words pointing to words. So, biology is still in a very sorry state. And because we are not allowed to take risk[s] that might kill people, um, we just don't experiment enough in biology. So, a lot of treatments are just <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;outright&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;直率地； 全部地， 彻底地&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:5&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adverb) Wholly; completely; entirely.; (Adjective) Unqualified and unreserved.; (Verb) To release a player outright, without conditions.&quot;}'>outright</span> banned by large <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;regulatory&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;按规矩来的， 依照规章的； 调整的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:12&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:2,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Of or pertaining to regulation.&quot;}'>regulatory</span> bodies. So, we just don't have the <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;innovation&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;创新， 革新&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:49&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) The act of innovating; the introduction of something new, in customs, rites, etc.&quot;}'>innovation</span>. So, I think we're still in the Stone Age when it comes to biology, and we got a long ways to go . Uh, and I think people will look back aghast at this. And I think this is Bryan Johnson's point. He's like, you know, &quot;Let's be more... more extreme. Let's try to live forever. It must be more <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;experimental&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;实验的， 用于实验的&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:32&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:3,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Adjective) Pertaining to or founded on experiment.; (Noun) The subject of an experiment.&quot;}'>experimental</span>. And I'll start as N of one and start experimenting on myself&quot;. And, um, but even there, I disagree with Bryan on many things. Like, you know, taking huge amounts of <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;supplement&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;补充， 增补&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) Something added; especially, such an addition added to make up for a deficiency.; (Verb) To provide or make a supplement to something.&quot;}'>supplements</span>.

Right? Um, but that's fine. And... and I wouldn't be vegan either. But, you know, it's... it's... I... I really appreciate that he's experimenting. He's good-natured about [it]. He shares everything. So, we need more people like that. Um, so I think the state of biology, people will look back and say, &quot;Wow, that was in the Dark Ages&quot;.</p></div></div>

<div class="msg chris"><div class="avatar">CW</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Chris</div><p>Yeah. I think, you know, so much of what we've spoken about today is on the shortness of life and, uh, the fact that every moment is precious.

<div class="msg naval"><div class="avatar">NR</div><div class="bubble"><div class="speaker-name">Naval</div><p>That's right. I used to think, you know, the currency of life, right? People think it's money. And yes, money is important, and it does let you trade certain things for time, but it doesn't really buy you time. Ask Warren Buffett how much time money can buy you, or Michael Bloomberg. They're, you know, rich as Scrooge... and... but they can't buy more time. Right? Bryan Johnson notwithstanding. Um, so you can't trade money for time. Money is not the real currency of life. And time itself doesn't even mean that much because, as we talked about before, a lot of time can be wasted because you're not really present for it. You're not paying attention. So, the real currency of life is attention. It's what you choose to pay attention to and... and what you do about it. And so, back to the point about the news media: you can put your attention on the news, but that's how you're spending the real currency of life. So, just be aware of that. If you want to, that's fine. There's no... there's no right or wrong here. Like, maybe it is your <span class="word" data-entry='{&quot;word&quot;:&quot;destiny&quot;,&quot;meaning&quot;:&quot;命运；天数， 天命&quot;,&quot;memory&quot;:&quot;SAT词频:2&quot;,&quot;stars&quot;:1,&quot;meaningEn&quot;:&quot;(Noun) That to which any person or thing is destined; a predetermined state; a condition predestined by the Divine or by human will.&quot;}'>destiny</span> to pick something in the news, learn about that problem, adopt that problem, and solve it.
